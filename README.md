# Clock Angle

#### _C#, .NET: Clock Angle, 12/16/2019_

## Description
It's a console application that tells the user, given a certain time, the distance in degrees between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock.

## Application should have:
It should use a `Clock` class with a method that takes a time as input, and returns a number of degrees as output.

For example, an input of 12:00 would return 0º and 6:00 would return 180º. Always return the smaller distance and be as precise as possible.

## Unit Testing
| User input | Expected output |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| 12, 0 | The degrees between hour and minute hands is 0 degrees. |
| 3, 0 | The degrees between hour and minute hands is 90 degrees. |
| 6, 0 | The degrees between hour and minute hands is 180 degrees. |
| 9, 0 | The degrees between hour and minute hands is 90 degrees. |
