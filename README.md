# Clock Angle

#### _C#, .NET: Clock Angle, 9/23/2019_

## Description
It's a console application that tells the user, given a certain time, the distance in degrees between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock.

## Application should have:
It should use a `Clock` class with a method that takes a time as input, and returns a number of degrees as output.

For example, an input of 12:00 would return 0º and 6:00 would return 180º. Always return the smaller distance and be as precise as possible.
